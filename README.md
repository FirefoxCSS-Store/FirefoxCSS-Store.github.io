## Generic Installation

+ Go to the wanted theme and click the download button.
+ You should now be on the Github page for that topic.
+ Below you should see a guide on how to install that particular theme and a few preview pictures. Anyway, here are some common steps for all themes.

1. Download the theme with the big green button: "Code" >> Download.zip
2. Open `about:config` page.
3. A dialog will warn you, but ignore it, ~~just do it~~ press the `I accept the risk!` button.
4. Search for these:

	+ **`toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`**
	+ **`layers.acceleration.force-enabled`**
	+ **`gfx.webrender.all`**
	+ **`gfx.webrender.enabled`**
	+ **`layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled`**
	+ **`svg.context-properties.content.enabled`**

	Then make sure to **enable them all!**

5. Go to your Firefox profile.

	+ Linux - `$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXX.default-XXXXXX/`.
	+ Windows - `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\XXXXXXX.default-XXXXXX`.
	+ macOS - `Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/XXXXXXX.default-XXXXXXX`.

6. Create a folder and name it **`chrome`**, then assuming that you already have cloned this repo, just copy the theme to `chrome` folder.
7. Restart Firefox.

## Add your theme <3

+ If you have a Github account:
  1. Fork this repository
  2. Look for a file called `themes.json`, open and edit it
  3. Below the last `}` add `,` right after a copy the [code below](#code) and paste it in the file
  4. Add the properties of your theme: **title**, **link**, **description**, **image** and **tag** (Cannot be left empty)
  5. **Avoid the use of escaped characters, and the order matters**
  6. Please, do not use a very big image, preferably (650x500)
  7. Image property:
    - You can put an image URL
    - Or an image file in `/images/themes/` (The file extension doesn't matter). And then reference it in your code with the following `assets/img/themes/YOUR_FILE_NAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION.webp`
  8. Then send it as a pull request to this repository.

+ Or create an Issue:
  1. When creating an issue, you will find a template for submitting a theme. Use that one. It's easy.

+ If you have a Twitter account:
  1. Send **at least** the following properties: **tags**, **title**, **link**, **description**, and **picture** to [@Neikon66](https://twitter.com/Neikon66). 

```
  {
    "title": "..........",
    "link": "..........",
    "description": "..........",
    "image": "..........",
    "tags": [ "your username/name", "theme type: dark", "theme type: light", "............." ]
  }
```

### Contribution: themes information

1. Install [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) in your machine.
2. Generate a [Github token API](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for your account and save it;
2. Clone the repository;
3. In your terminal, change directory into the `/scripts/` folder.
4. Run `nu`.
5. Run `use sort_themes.nu`;
6. Run `sort_themes --help` and read and understand the flags;
7. Run `sort_themes --github YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN`;
8. Check if everything ran fine, if yes, replace the new generated `themes.json` file.
9. Commit your changes.
10. Open a pull request and send your contribution for us to review.
11. Thank you :)

**Why generate a token API for only Github?**

Most themes' repositories are in Gitub, so it's pretty easy to hit the anonymous rate limit for API calls. With a token, that limit is higher, making it easier to contribute.
